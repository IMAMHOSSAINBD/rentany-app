                    You agree to defend and indemnify Wego, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and associated companies and/or their respective suppliers and any of their officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other costs or expenses of any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought by third parties as a result of (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party; or (c) your use of the Services.

                    Wego’s logo(s) and slogan(s) are trademarks of Wego. Other product and company names mentioned herein may be the trademarks of their respective owners.

                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">9. Third-party Providers and Sites</h5>

                <p>
                    9.1 The third parties offering travel product options, or products or services that are accessible or bookable through the Services are independent contractors and are not agents or employees of Wego or its subsidiaries, associated companies or affiliates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9.2 You understand the mere fact that the Services displays travel product options, or offer the sale of products or services of certain third parties does not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute any sponsorship or approval by Wego of any such provider or any affiliation between any such provider and Wego. Unless otherwise expressly stated, Wego’s display of specific options does not suggest a recommendation by Wego of the providers or their travel options, products or services.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9.3 You agree that Wego is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of information it may obtain on your behalf from these travel product providers or travel deal providers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9.4 You have to transact with and make payment directly to third party travel service providers or their agents which are displayed by the Services. Your interaction with any travel product provider accessed through the Services is at your own risk and may be based on terms and conditions imposed independently of Wego by such third parties, and Wego shall have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any such suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting there from.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9.5 Furthermore, the Wego owned or branded websites and the Services contain hyperlinks to websites operated by parties other than Wego. Wego does not control such websites and is not responsible for their contents. Wego also does not control the contents of or information published by any third party travel deal provider. Wego’s inclusion of hyperlinks to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h5 class="font-weight-bold">10. Miscellaneous</h5>

                <p>
                    You may not assign, delegate or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms. You will review these Terms periodically. If Wego fails to act with respect to your breach of these Terms or anyone else’s breach on any occasion, Wego is not waiving our right to act with respect to future or similar breaches. These Terms are governed by the laws of Singapore without reference to its choice of law principles. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Singapore, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Services. Use of the Services is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this Section. If any part of these Terms are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and these Terms shall continue in effect. These Terms (and the Privacy Policy referenced herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Wego with respect to the Services and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and Wego with respect to the Services.
